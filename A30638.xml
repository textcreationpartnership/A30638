         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have read over your <hi>Collections,</hi> and if you be pleaſed to ſatisfie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of your friends, and to commit them to publike view, I think you ſhall doe very well; yea, my opinion is, you ought to doe it. This Candle ſhould not be under a buſhel, but on a Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick. The light of it wil be moſt uſefull many waies. Firſt, the example will be exceeding good; you (as many others) were by the troubles of this Kingdom taken off from you ordinary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but you would not be taken off all imployment; and that albeit your yeares required eaſe; and your age (at leaſt) an abatement of your labours, yet here is neither, but rather an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of more diligence and harder labour, and your declining time more flouriſhing and fruitfull, then your youth and beſt dayes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:31488:6"/>
            <p>Then, you pitched on the beſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: what other you might have been fit for, by reaſon of your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer condition, and preſent age, I doe not know; I am confident, if you had been fit for any whatſoever, yet for none more, then for the Worke you have performed. Here is wiſdome, and this very choice, &amp; in very much varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and an admirable flowing veine of moſt ſweet and ſacred eloquence. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there mixture of any imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, at leaſt, there is not any thing abſurd, or that admitteth not a very good conſtruction.</p>
            <p>I will tell you what happened to me in the reading of it, from approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I was carried unto admiration; almoſt to amazement. I ſee the race is not alwaies unto the ſwift, and the choyſeſt Jewels, are not ſeldome hid in cloſeſt ſecrecy. And how often doe things fall far ſhort of expectation, but ſometimes alſo, they as farre exceede the ſame.</p>
            <p>Your Wine is good throughout your whole Feaſt, but not beſt in the beginning; your vertue is in the midſt, but your midſt-is almoſt all your Book,
<pb facs="tcp:31488:7"/> at leaſt, by many degrees the greateſt part of it.</p>

They mortified their earthly Members; we looſe the bridle to all beaſtly deſires, and care altogether, for temporall traſh; ſeldom, if at all, do we ſubdue our affections, neither do we deſire to profit more and more, dayly in well doing; if therefore we remain in Religion, either cold or luke-warme, what marvell? But were we dead unto our own ſelves, and not intangled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with parturbations, doubtleſſe we ſhould taſte the unſpeakable ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a godly life: and be inflamed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31488:20"/> with a burning deſire of celeſtiall things; for in very deed, the greateſt, (if not the whole) let from godlineſſe, is becauſe we are in bondage to vild af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and labour not to follow the foot-ſteps of the faithfull. Hence it is, that if we be never ſo lightly touched with adverſity, we are marvelouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, and ſeek help of man, which cometh of the Lord, now would we keep our places, like valiant Souldiers, the Lord would help us from above; for he is ready to aſſiſt them which ſerve him, and will give us victory if we fight his battles. But if we place our Religion in doing theſe outward things, in ſhort time our Religion with them will utterly decay; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Axe muſt be laid unto the root, and our wicked affections muſt be cut off, which is the only way to find reſt for our ſoules. If every year we would but root out one vice from our mindes, oh how quickly ſhould we prove good men. But alas, we ſee by experience, that after many years, we are worſe then at the firſt, when we begin for to profeſſe Religion. And he is an holy man counted now a dayes,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:31488:21"/> which can retain a part of his former zeal; yet ſhould the fire of godlineſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe dayly, and be inflamed more and more. The remedy whereof is, at the begining to ſtrain our ſelves, ſo ſhall we afterwards do all things at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I confeſſe indeeed it is hard, for to leave an old cuſtome and as hard, yea harder, for a man to bridle his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. At the begining therefore ſtrive with thine inclination, and leave a wicked cuſtom, leaſt otherwiſe when thou wouldeſt thou canſt not eaſily; for it is impoſſible that we ſhould vanquiſh and ſubdue mighty, which cannot overcome light and trifling things. Oh if thou wouldeſt conſider, what quietneſſe to thy ſelf, and joy to others, thou ſhouldeſt bring by godly, and good beheaviour, doubtleſſe thy chiefeſt care would be how to live in the ſight of God religiouſly, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly in the eyes of men.</p>

               <p>WEe ought not to doe wickedly, for any thing, nor for any mans ſake; albeit in reſpect of the weake, a good work may be undone ſometimes, or done otherwiſe: And that is not to neglect a good work, but to leave one good work, to do a better. If thou have not love, there outward deeds profit nothing; if thou have love, be thy works never ſo ſmall and ſimple, they profit much, for God reſpecteth not what is done, but how, and with what affection a thing is done. Hee doth much, that loveth much; hee doth much, that doth a thing as it ſhould be done, and he doth ſo that ſeeketh the common welfare before his owne profit. It many times ſeemeth a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table deed, which indeed is a carnall: for that which is done, as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly workes are done, either of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

A man indued with perfect charity, ſerveth not his owne turne, but onely in all things ſeeketh the glory of God. He envieth not, for he loveth no private joy, neither will rejoyce in himſelfe, but in the Lord, whoſe bleſſing hee deſireth before all things.

And this we find true, when we talk much together; It is eaſier to be altogether ſilent, then not to exceed in words, and to tarry at home then not to offend abroad it is eaſier. Wherefore he which would be zealous, and godly, muſt avoid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. No man doth ſafely go abroad, but he which gladly can abide at home, no man ſafely doth govern, but he which gladly can be in ſubjection. No man ſafely doth Command, but he that hath learned willingly to obey. No man ſafely is merry, but he that hath a good Conſcience. And no man ſafely can ſpeak, but he that willingly can hold his peace. And yet hath not the ſecurity of good men, at any time been without the fear of God, neither did their excellent, and heavenly gifts make them any whit proud, but the more humble. But the ſecurity of the wicked, as it ariſeth of pride, ſo it turneth to their diſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Never look to live at thy hearts eaſe, in this world, ſeem thou never ſo godly and religious. It faileth out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

If man would caſt away all vain cares, and think only upon heavenly things, and truſt only in God, what a continuall joy ſhould he feele in his mind? No man ſhall find any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall comfort, except he occupie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diligently in ſtirring up his mind unto godlineſſe: the which thou ſhalt the more eaſily attain, if thou enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Chamber, and ſhut thy ſelf from troubles of the world, as it is written. Examin your own hearts upon your bed, and be ſtill.

Solitarineſſe, and quietneſſe, is good for him that would proceed in vertue, and learn the myſteries of holy Scripture; for there ſhall he find even floods of teares, whereby he may waſh and clenſe himſelf every night, that he may be ſo much nigher unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, by how much he is further from the reſort of men. So that God with his holy Angels cometh unto him, which withdraweth himſelf from his friends and acquaintance. It is better to live in a corner, ſo a man have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to himſelf, then without care of his own ſalvation, even to work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. It is no ſhame, but praiſe, for a godly man ſeldom to go abroad, to ſhun to be ſeen, and not to love to ſee. Why lookeſt thou on that which is not lawfull for thee to have?

               <p>O poor Chriſtian, what wilt thou do a midſt the multitude of ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous calamities? It is a wonderfull matter, and able (as one further faith) to make a reaſonable man go out of his wits, to conſider what God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto us, in the Scriptures, of the dreadfull Circumſtance of this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet to ſee how little the retchleſſe men of the world do feare it.</p>
               <p>Now is the time we may avoyde all, now is the time we may put our ſelves out of danger, of theſe matters; now (I ſay) if we reſolve our ſelves out of hand, for we know not what will become of us to morrow. It may be to morrow, our hearts will be as hard, and careleſſe of theſe things, as they have been heretofore.</p>
               <p>Reſolve thy ſelf therefore (my dear brother) if thou be wiſe, and clear thy ſelf from this danger; while God is willing to receive thee, and moveth thee thereunto by theſe meanes, as he did the rich man by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:31488:39"/> Prophets, while he was yet in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity.</p>
               <p>Let his example be often before thine eyes, and conſider it throughly, and it ſhall do thee good, God is a mereifull God, and a wonderfull God, and to ſhew his patience, and infinite goodneſſe, he woeth us in this life, ſeeketh unto us, and layeth himſelf, (as it were) at our feete, to move us to our own good, to win us, to draw us, and to ſave us from perdition.</p>
               <p>But after this life, he altereth his courſe of dealing, he turneth over the leaf, and changeth his ſtile; Of a Lamb, he becometh a Lyon to the wicked. And of a Saviour, a juſt and ſevere puniſher.</p>
               <p>What can be ſaid, or done more, to move us? He that is forewarned, and ſeeth his own danger before his, face &amp; yet is not ſtirred, nor made the more warie, or fearfull thereby, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, will come, or ſlide into the ſame, may well be pittied, but ſurely by no means, can he be helped. making himſelf incapable of all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies that may be uſed.</p>

But that all hearts are not of one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, in this reſpect, not all drawn and ſtirred, with the ſame meanes. I purpoſe to adjoyne here another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, whereunto each man is commonly proane by nature. And therefore I am in hope, it will be more forcible to that we goe about, then any elſe, that hitherto hath been ſpoken. I meane then to treat of the ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fits, which are reaped by the ſervice of God; of the gaine drawn thence, and of the good pay and moſt liberall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which God performeth to his ſervants, above all the maſters created, that may be ſerved.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:31488:40"/>
               <p>And though the juſt fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (if we ſerve him not) might be ſufficient to drive us to this reſolution; and the infinite benefits already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, induce us to the ſame, in reſpect of gratitude: Yet am I content ſo far to enlarge this liberty to the (good Reader) that except I ſhew this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, (which I crave) to be more gainefull and profitable, then any thing elſe in the world that can be thought of; thou ſhalt not be bound unto it for any thing, that hitherto hath been ſaid in that behalfe. For as God in all things, is a God of great Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, full of bounty, liberality, and princely magnificence; ſo is he in this point above all other, in ſuch ſort, as albeit, whatſoever we doe, or can do, is but due debt unto him, and of it ſelfe deſerveth nothing. Yet of this munificent Majeſtie, he letteth paſſe no one jot of our ſervice unrewarded, no not ſo much as a cup of cold water.</p>
               <p>God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice unto him his onely Sonne <hi>Iſack</hi> which he loved ſo much; but when he was ready to doe the ſame, God ſaid, doe it not; It is enough for me, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:31488:41"/> I ſee thy obedience. And becauſe thou haſt not refuſed to doe it, I ſweare to thee (ſaith he) by my ſelfe, that I will multiply thy ſeed, as the ſtarres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the ſands of the Sea: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them alſo one ſhall be Chriſt the Saviour of the world. Was not this good pay for ſo little paines? King <hi>David,</hi> one night began to think with himſelfe, that he had ow a houſe of Cedar, and the Arke of God lay but under a Tent, and therefore reſolved to build a Houſe for the ſaid Arke: which onely cogitation, God took in ſo good part, as he ſent <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet unto him preſently to refuſe the thing: but yet to tell him, that forſomuch, as he had determined ſuch a matter, God would build a houſe, or rather a K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngdome to him and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie; which ſhould laſt for ever; and from which he would never take away his mercy; which promiſe we ſee now fulfilled in Chriſt; what ſhould I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite many like examples; Chriſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a generall note hereof, when he calleth the workmen, &amp; payeth to each man his wages, ſo duly; as alſo when he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Behold, I come quickly,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:31488:41"/> and my reward is with me:</hi> by which place is evident, that God ſuffereth no labour in his ſervice to be loſt, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid. And albeit, he payeth alſo, and that abundantly in this life: yet, as by thoſe two examples appeareth, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth his chiefe pay unto his coming in the end of the day, that is after this life, in the reſurrection of the juſt; as himſelfe ſaith in another place, of this payment then reſerved for Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the life to come.</p>
               <p>We are now to conſider, what, and what manner a thing it is, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be worth ſo much labour and travell, as the ſervice of God requireth, or no.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all, if we will beleeve the holy Scripturs, calling it a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> an <hi>heavenly Kingdome,</hi> an <hi>everlaſting Kingdome,</hi> a <hi>moſt bleſſed Kingdome.</hi> We muſt needes confeſſe it to be a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous great reward. For that worldly Princes, doe not uſe to give Kingdoms to their ſervants, for recompence of their labours: and if they did, or were able to doe it; yet could it be neither heavenly, nor everlaſting, nor a bleſſed Kingdome.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:31488:42"/>
               <p>Secondly, if we credit that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of it; that neither eye hath ſeen, nor eare heard, nor heart of man conceived, how great a matter it is; Then muſt we yet admit a greater opinion thereof: for that we have ſeen many wonderfull things in our dayes, we have heard more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, we may conceive moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and almoſt infinit. How then ſhall we come to underſtand the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and value of the rewards? ſurely no tongue created, either of man, or Angel, can expreſſe the ſame. No imagination conceive, no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding comprehend it, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath ſaid, no man knoweth it, but he that injoyeth it, and therefore he calleth it, hidden <hi>Manna,</hi> in the ſame place; notwithſtanding as it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a learned <hi>Geometrician,</hi> that finding the length of <hi>Hercules</hi> foote upon the hill of <hi>Olimpus,</hi> drew out his whole body by the proportion of that one part: ſo we by ſome thing only ſet down in Scripture, and by ſome other Circumſtances, agreeing thereunto, may frame a conjecture of the matter, though it come far behind
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:31488:42"/> the thing it ſelf.</p>
               <p>I have ſhewed before, how the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calleth it a heavenly, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and a moſt bleſſed Kingdom; whereby is ſignified, that all muſt be Kings, that are admitted thither: To take effect it is called in other places; a Crown of glory, a Throne of Majeſty, a Paradice, or place of pleaſure; a life everlaſting. St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his baniſhment, by ſpeciall priviledge, made privy to ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and feeling thereof, as well for his own comfort, as for ours, taketh in and to deſcribe it by compariſon of City, affirming that the whole City, was of pure gold, with a great, and high wall of the precious ſtone, called <hi>Jaſpis.</hi> This wall had alſo 12. founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, made of 12. diſtinct precious ſtones, which he there nameth: alſo 12. gates, made of 12. rich ſtones, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Margarites,</hi> and every gate hath an entire <hi>Margarite.</hi> The ſtreets of the City, were paved with gold, interlaid alſo with pearles, and precious ſtones. the light of the City, was the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſhining of Chriſt himſelf, ſiting in the midſt thereof.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:31488:43"/>
               <p>From whoſe ſeate proceeded a Ri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver of water, as cleare as Criſtall, to refreſh the City, and on both ſides of the bankes, there grew the tree of life giving out continuall and perpetual fruit: There was no night in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty, nor any defiled thing entred there but they that are within ſhall raign (ſaith he) for ever, and ever.</p>
               <p>By this deſcription, of the moſt rich and precious things that this world hath, St. <hi>John</hi> would give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the infinite value, glory, and majeſty of this felicity, prepared for us in heaven: though, as I have noted before) it being the princely inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of our Saviour Chriſt, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Father, the eternall habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Trinity, prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all worlds, to ſet out the glory, and expreſſe the power, of him that hath no end, not meaſure, either in power, or glory: we may very well think with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that neither tongue can declare it, nor heart can imagine it.</p>
               <p>O miſerable Children of men, that are born to ſo rare and ſinguler a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and yet cannot be brought, to conſider love, or eſteem of the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:31488:43"/>
               <p>Other ſuch conſiderations there be, to ſhew the greatneſſe of this felicity, is that if God hath given ſo many pleaſures, and comfortable guifts in this life (as we ſee are in this world) being a place of banniſhment, a place of ſinners, a vail of miſery, and the time of repenting, weeping and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what will he do in the life to come, to the juſt, to his friends, in the time of joy, and marriage of his Son? This was a moſt forceable conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with good St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who in the ſecret ſpeech of his ſoule with God, ſaid thus.

When there ſhall be laid down in that honourable Conſiſtory, all thy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous deeds, al thy labors that thou haſt taken in thy calling; all thy almes, all thy prayers, all thy faſting, all thy innocence of life, all thy patience in injuries, all thy conſtancie in adverſities, all thy tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in meats, all thy vertues of thy whole life? When all (I ſay) ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted there, al commended, all rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; ſhalt thou not ſee now, the value &amp; profit of a vertuous life? ſhalt thou not confeſs, that gainful, &amp; honorable, is the ſervice of God? Shalt thou not now be glad, &amp; bleſs the hour, wherein firſt thou reſolvedſt thy ſelf to leave the ſervice of the world, to ſerve God? Shalt thou not think thy ſelfe to be beholden to him that perſwaded thee unto it? Yes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily: But yet more then this, when as being ſo neere thy paſsage here, thou
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:31488:46"/> ſhalt conſider into what a port, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of ſecurity thou art come, and ſhalt looke backe upon the dangers which thou haſt paſſed, and wherein other men are yet in hazzard; thy cauſe of joy ſhall greatly be increaſed. For thou ſhalt ſee evidently, how infinite times, thou wert in danger to have periſhed in that journey, if God had not held his provident hand over thee.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt ſee the dangers wherein other men are; the death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereinto many of thy friends and acquaintance have fallen; the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall paines of Hell incurred by many, that uſed to laugh and be merry with them in this world. All which ſhall aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the felicity of this thy bleſſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. And now for thy ſelfe, thou mayeſt be ſecure thou art out of all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>There is now no more need of feare, of watchings, of labour, of care; thou mayeſt lay down all armour now, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might have done when they had gotten the Land of promiſe; for there is no more Enemy to aſſault thee, there is no wily Serpent to beguile thee. All is peace,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31488:46"/> all is reſt, all is joy, all is ſecurity. Thy onely exerciſe, muſt be now to rejoyce, to tryumph, to ſing <hi>Hallelujah</hi> to the Lambe, which hath brought thee to this felicitie, and will keep thee in the ſame, world without end.</p>
               <p>But now to draw towards an end in this matter, (though there be no end in the thing it ſelfe) let the Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſider, whereto he is borne, and whereof he is in poſſibilitie if he will. He is born heire apparent to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, a Kingdome without end, a Kingdome without meaſure, a Kingdome of bliſſe, the Kingdome of God himſelf: he is borne to be joynt heire with Jeſus Chriſt, the Sonne of God, to raigne with him, to triumph with him, to ſit in judgement with him, to judge the very Angels with him. What more glory can be thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except it were to become God himſelfe? All the joyes, all the riches, all the glory that heaven containeth, ſhall be powred out upon him, who wil not eſteeme of this royall Inheritance? Eſpecially, ſeeing that now we have ſo good opportunity, to the obtaining thereof, by the benefit of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:31488:47"/> and grace purchaſed to us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>Tell me now (Gentle Reader) why wilt thou not accept of this his offer? Why wilt thou not accompt of this his Kingdome? Why wilt thou not buy this glory of him, for ſo little a labour, as he requireth? There is not the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedeſt man in the world, but taketh more travell and pains in going to Hell, then the moſt painefull ſervant of God in obtaining of heaven. Follow thou not their folly then (deare brother) for thou ſhalt ſee them ſuffer greevouſly for it one day; when thy heart ſhall be full gald thou hadſt no part among them. Let them goe now, and beſtow their time in vanitie, in pleaſures, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the world. Let them build Pall ces, purchaſe Dignities, and peeces and patches of ground together; Let them hunt after Honours, and build Caſtels in the Ayre, the day will come (if thou beleeve Chriſt himſelfe) wherein thou ſhalt have ſmall cauſe to envie their felicity.</p>
               <p>To conclude then, this prize is ſet up for them that will ſtrive for it. For tis not every one that ſaith to Chriſt,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:31488:47"/> 
                  <hi>Lord, Lord, that ſhall enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven: but they onely which doe the will of Christ his Father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Though this Kingdome of Chriſt be ſet out to all: yet every man ſhall not come to raigne with Chriſt; but ſuch onely, as ſhall be content to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with Chriſt. Thou art therefore to ſit down, and conſider, according to thy Saviours councell what thou wilt doe, whether thou have ſo much ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall money as is ſufficient to build this Towre, or no: That is, whether thou have ſo much good will as to beſtow the paines of ſuffering with Chriſt, (if it be rather to be called pain then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) that ſo thou maiſt raigne with him in his Kingdome. This is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that is the very whole iſsue of the matter, that hath been ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either of thy particular end, or of the Majeſtie, bounty, and juſtice of God; and of the account he wil demand of thee. Alſo of the puniſhment or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, laid up for thee. All this is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to this end, that thou wouldeſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reſolve what thou ſhouldeſt doe; and not to paſs over thy t me in care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs negligence, as many doe: never

For the love of God, then (deare brother) and for the love that thou beareſt to thine owne ſoule, ſhake off this dangerous ſecurity, which fleſh and blood is wont to lull men in; and make ſome earneſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, for looking for thy ſoule in the life to come, remember often that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſentence; This life is but a moment of time, whereof all eternity of life, or death to come dependeth. If it be a moment, and a moment of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, how is it paſt over by world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, with ſo little care as it is? And if all this thatc hath been ſaid (gentle Reader) will not prevaile with thee, little hope is there, that any other will doe thee good. Wherefore here I end, beſeeching our Lord God, and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, which was content to pay his own blood, for the purchaſing this noble inheritance unto us, give us his holy grace, to eſteeme of it as the great waight of the matter requireth; and not by negligence to loſe our portions therein.</p>

               <p>VAriety in any thing diſturbeth the mind, and leaves it waving in a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious trouble; and then, how eaſie is it, to ſway the mind to either ſide? But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the diverſities that wee meet with, none troubles us more, then thoſe that are of Religion. Tis rare to finde two Kingdoms one; as if every Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had (if not a God, yet at leaſt) a way to God by it ſelfe. This ſtumbles the unſetled ſoule: that not knowing which way to take, without danger of erring, ſticks to none; ſo dyes, ere he doe that for which he was made to live, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the true Almighty.</p>
               <p>We are borne as men ſet down in the middeſt of a Wood: circled round with ſeverall voyces calling us. At firſt we ſee not, which will lead us the right way out: So divided in our ſelves, we ſit ſtill, and follow none, remaining blind in a flat Atheiſme; which ſtrickes deep at the Foundation, both of our own, &amp; the whole worlds happineſs. Tis true, if we let our dimmed underſtanding ſearch in theſe varieties (which yet is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:31488:50"/> the onely meanes that we have in our ſelves, to do it with) we ſhall certainly loſe our ſelves in our windings; there being in every of them, ſome thing to beleeve, above that reaſon which leads us to the ſearch.</p>
               <p>Reaſon gives us the Annatomy of things, and illuſtrates with a great deale of plaineneſs, all the waies that ſhee goes; but her line is too ſhort to reach the depths of Religion: Religion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a confutation along with it: and with a high hand of ſoveragnity, awes the inquiſitive tongue of nature: and when ſhee would ſometimes murmur privately, ſhe will not let her ſpeake; Reaſon like a milde Prince, is content to ſhew his ſubjects the cauſes of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and rule; Religion with a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtraine of Majeſtie, bids doe it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inquiring further then the bare command, which without doubt, is a meanes of procuring mighty reverence. What we know not, we reverently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire; what we doe know, is in ſome ſort ſubject to the triumphs of the ſoul, that hath diſcovered it: and this not knowing, makes us not able to judge. Every one tells us, his own is the trueſt,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:31488:50"/> and there is none, I thinke, but hath been ſealed with the blood of ſome, nor can I ſee, how we may more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably, prove any; they being all ſet in ſuch heights, as they are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the demonſtrations of reaſon.</p>
               <p>And as wee may eaſier ſay, what a ſoule is not, then what it is: ſo we may more eaſily diſproove a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for falſe, then proove it for one that is true. There being in the world farre more error then truth. Yet is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, another miſery, neere as great as this, and that is, that we cannot be our owne chouſers, but muſt take it upon truſt from others. Are we not oft, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for we can diſcerne the true, brought up and grounded in the falſe, ſuckng Hereſie with our milke in childhood? Nay, when we come to yeares of abler judgement, wherein the mind is grown up compleate man; we examine not the ſoundneſs, but retaine it meerely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Fathers taught it us: what a lamentable weakneſs is this in man, that he ſhould build his eternall well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, on the approbation of, perhaps, a weake and ignorant Parent? Oh, why is our neglect, the moſt in that, wherein
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:31488:51"/> our care ſhould be greateſt? How few are there which fulfill that precept, of trying all things, and taking the beſt? Aſsuredly though Faith be above Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet is there a reaſon to be given of our faith: he is a foole that beleeves he knows not what, nor why.</p>
               <p>Among all the diverſities of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the world holds, I think it may ſtand with moſt ſafety, to take that, which makes moſt for Gods glory, and mans quiet.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, in all the Treatiſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that I ever ſaw,; I find none that I ſhould ſo ſoone follow, as that of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> I never found ſo ſound foundation, ſo ſure a direction for Religion, as the Song of the Angels at the birth of Chriſt. <hi>Glory be to God on high.</hi> There is the honour, the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent obedience, and the admiration, and the adoration which we ought to give him. <hi>On earth peace.</hi> This is the effect of the former, working in the hearts of men, whereby the world ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in his nobleſt beuty, being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire chaine of inter-mutuall amity. <hi>And good will towards men.</hi> This is Gods mercy, to reconcile man to himſelfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>Search all Religions the world through, and you will find none, that aſcribes ſo much to God, nor that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes ſo firm a love among men, as does the eſtabliſht Doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church among us.

               <p>THey that are Divines without Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, can hardly maintain the truth in their diſputations: 'tis poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they may have an infuſed faith, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for themſelves: but if they have not reaſon too, they will ſcarcely make others capable of their inſtruction: certainly, Divinity, and morallity are not ſo averſe, but that they well may live together. For, if nature be rectified by Religion, Religion is ſtrengthned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by nature: And as ſome hold of fate, that there is nothing happens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but is writ above in the Starrs, only we have not skill to find it: So I beleeve there is nothing in Religion that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reaſon, if we knew it rightly. For converſation among men, and the true happineſs of man, Philoſophy hath agreed with Scripture.</p>
               <p>Nay, I think I may alſo adde, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining of God, except the Trinity, as neare as man can conceive him: how exact hath he made Juſtice? how buſie to find out truth? how rightly directed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:31488:54"/> love? exalting with much earneſtneſs, all thoſe graces, that are any way ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: He that ſeekes in <hi>Plato,</hi> ſhall find him, making God the <hi>ſolum ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum.</hi> To which a pure, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life is the way. For defining God, my opinion is, that man, neither by divinity, nor Philoſophy can, as they ſay, tell what he is. It is fitter for man to adore, and admire him, then in vain to ſtudy to comprehend him. God is for man to ſtand amazed, &amp; wonder at.</p>
               <p>The clogged and droſſie ſoule, can never ſound him, who is the unimagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Fountain of ſpirits, and from whom all things by a gradnate deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have their light, life, and being. In theſe things they agree. But I find three other things wherein Divinity overtoureth nature: In the Creation of the world, in the redemption of man, and in the way and rites, wherein God will be worſhipped: In the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, no Philoſophy, could ever reach at that, which <hi>Moſes</hi> taught us. Here the Humaniſts were all at a ſtand, and far, all their conjectures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather witty, and conceits, then true and reall. Some would have all things
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:31488:54"/> from fire, ſome from Ayre, ſome from water, ſome from earth, ſome from numbers, ſome from attomies, from ſimples ſome, and ſome from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds. <hi>Ariſtottle</hi> came the neareſt in finding out the trueſt <hi>materia prima;</hi> but becauſe he could not believe this made of nothing, he is content to erre, and think it was eternall. Surely, his conceit was as far from reaſon as the other, his reaſon might have fled unto omnipotency, as well as to eternity: And ſo indeed when Philoſophy hath gone as far as ſhe is able, ſhe ariveth at Almightineſſe, and in that <hi>Abbi</hi> is loſt, where not knowing the way, ſhe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but by gueſſe, and cannot tell when ſhe is, or right, or wrong; yet is ſhe rather ſubordinate, then contrary. Nature is not croſſe, but runs into om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, and like a petty River, is ſwallowed in that bondles Main. For the redemption of man: Even the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calles it a myſtery, and all that humanity could ever reach of this, was only a flying to the generall name of mercy, by the urgins of the Conſcience; They all knew they had failed and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, their own boſomes would tell

               <p>This was a worke that God declared onely to his own peculier: by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate revelation of his Word, &amp; Will.</p>

In the firſt Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> grants, <hi>That they may know God, through the viſibilities of his works:</hi> but for their ignorance in this, he ſayes: <hi>The wrath of God is revealed againſt them, becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, but turned the glory of the incomparable God to the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the Image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and of foure-footed beaſts, and of creeping things.</hi> And theſe three things the Scripture teacheth us, which elſe we could never have learned, from all the Books in the world. Thus we ſee for Morality, nature ſtill is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing peart and vigorous. But in the things of God, it is confirmed that ſhee is thick ſighted, and cannot ſee them.

               <p>One is, we childe that in a looſe laughter, which ſhould be grave, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:31488:58"/> ſavour both of love and pitty. So we rub him with a poyſoned oyle, which ſpreads the more for being put in ſuch a fleeting ſuppleneſs.</p>
               <p>The other is, we deſend to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and by that meanes, draw the whole Company to witneſs his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace we break it on.</p>
               <p>The Souldier is not noble, that makes himſelf ſport, with the wounds of his own Companion. Whoſoever will jeſt, ſhould be like him that flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes at a ſhow: He may turne his weapon any way, but not any more, at one then at another.</p>
               <p>In this caſe things like truth, are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then truth it ſelf, nor is it leſſe ill, then unſafe, to fling about this worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood of the braine: Some noſes are too tender to indure the ſtrength of the ſmell. And though there be many like tiled houſes, that can admit a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſpark, unwarm'd; yet ſome again, are covered with ſuch light drye ſtraw, that with the eaſt touch they will kindle, and flame about your troubled eares: and when the houſe is on fire, it is no diſputing, with how ſmall a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it came: it will quickly proceede
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:31488:59"/> to miſchief. Anger is but a ſtep from rage, and that is wildfire, which will not be extinguiſhed. I know, wiſe men are not too nimble at an injury: For, as with fire, the light ſtuffe, and rubbiſh, kindles ſooner, then the ſolid, and more compacted; ſo anger ſooner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames a foole, then a man compoſed in his reſolutions. But we are not ſure alwayes to meete diſcreete ones: nor can we hope it, while we our ſelves are otherwiſe, in giving the occaſion.</p>
               <p>Fooles are the greater number: wiſe men are like Timber trees in a wood, here and there one: and though they be moſt acceptable, to men, wiſe, like themſelves, yet have they never more need of wiſdom, then when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the ringing elboes: who, like corrupt Ayre, require many Antidotes, to keepe us from being infected: But when they grow bitter to a wiſe man, we are then worſe; for he ſees further into the diſgrace, and is able to harme us more.</p>
               <p>Laughter ſhould dimple the cheeke, not furrow the brow into rudgedneſs: The birth is then prodigious, when miſchief is the child of mirth. All
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:31488:59"/> ſhould have liberty to laugh at a jeſt, but if it throwes a diſgrace upon one, like a crack of a ſtring it makes a ſtop in the Muſick. Flouts we may ſee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from an inward contempt, and there is nothing cuts deeper in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous minde then ſcorne. Nature at firſt makes us all equall, we are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced but by accident, and outwards; and I thinke it is a jealouſie that ſhe hath infuſed in man for the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of her owne honour againſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall cauſes, and though all have not wit to reject the Arrow, yet moſt have memory to retaine the offence; which they will be content to owne a while, that they may repay it both with more advantage and eaſe. 'Tis but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy wit that ſtirs up enemies againſt the owner, a man may ſpit out his friend from his tongue, or laugh him into an enemy.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:31488:62"/> noble Maſter; worth will never faile to give deſert her bayes. A liberall Maſter that loves his Servant well, is in ſome ſort a god unto him, which may both give him bleſſings and protect him from danger. And beleeve it on the other ſide, a diligent and diſcreet ſervant is one of the beſt friends that a man can be bleſt withall; he can doe whatſoever a friend may, and will be commanded with leſſer hazzard of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; nay, he may in a kinde challenge a glory above his Maſter, for though it be harder to play a Kings part well, then 'tis to act a Subjects, yet Natures inclination is much more bent to rule then obey, ſervice being a condition which is not found in any Creatures of one kinde but man: Now if the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be when men meet in theſe relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Who ſhall the firſt begin, the lot will ſurely fall upon the ſervant, for he is tyed in duty to be diligent, and that ever bindes without exception. The Lord is tyed but by his Honour, which is voluntary, and not compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, liberality being a free adjection, and not a tye in his bargaine. 'Tis good ſometimes for a Lord to uſe a ſervant
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:31488:62"/> like a friend, like a companion, but 'tis alwaies fit for a ſervant to pay him the reverence due to a Maſter: pride becomes neither the Commander, nor the commanded. Every Family is but a ſeveralll plumbe of Feathers, the meaneſt is of the ſelfe ſame ſtuffe, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he that made the plumbe was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſet the Lord higheſt: the power of commanding is rather politicall then from equall natute.</p>
               <p>The ſervice of man to man followed not the Creation, but the fall of man; and till <hi>Noah</hi> curſed his ſonne, the name of ſervant is not read in Scripture; ſince there is no abſolute freedome to be found below: Even Kings are but more ſplended Servants for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Body. There is a mutuality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Lord and Vaſſels. The Lord ſerves them of neceſſaries, and they him in pleaſures, and conveniencies; vertue is the trueſt liberty, nor is he free that ſtoops to paſſions, nor he in bondage that ſerves a noble Maſter. When <hi>Demonax</hi> ſaw one cruell in the beating of a ſervant; Eye (ſayes he) forbeare, leaſt by the world your ſelfe be taken for the ſervant. And if

               </q>
               <p>Imperiouſneſſe turnes that ſervant into a ſlave, which moderation makes as an humble ſpeaking friend. <hi>Seneca</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins an Epiſtle with rejoycing, that his friend lived familiar with his ſervant. Neither can have comfort where both are uncommunicable; I doe confeſſe the like countenance is not to be ſhewed to all; That which makes a wiſe man modeſt, makes a foole un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly: 'Tis the ſaucy ſervant that cauſes the Lord to ſhrinke his deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding favours, of the two, pride is the more tollerable in a Maſter; The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is prepoſterouſneſſe, which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaw the earth did groane for. <hi>Hadrian</hi> ſent his inferiour ſervant a box on the eare for walking but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two Senators. As I would not ſerve to be admitted to nothing but to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:31488:63"/> high commands, ſo I thinke, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is rudely malepert blemiſhes the diſcretion of himſelfe, and his Lord. As there ought to be equality, becauſe Nature has made it; ſo there ought to be a difference, becauſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune has ſet it; yet cannot the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their fortunes be ſo much as their neareneſſe in being men: no fate can fright away that likeneſſe.</p>
               <p>Let not the Lord abuſe his ſervant, for 'tis poſſible he may fall below him: Let not the ſervant neglect his Maſter, for he may be caſt to a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner condition: Let the ſervant deſerve, and the Maſter recompence; and if they would both be noble, the beſt way is for thoſe that be ſubject to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their ſervices, and for thoſe that are Commanders to remember them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So, each loving other for their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous worthineſſe, the world ſhall ſtrew praiſes in both their paths.

In proſperity who will not profeſſe to love a man? In adverſity, how few will ſhew it, that they doe it indeed? When we are happy in the ſpring-tide of abundance, and the riſing floud of plenty, then the world will be our ſervant, then all men will flock about us with bared heads, with bended bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and proteſting tongues: but when theſe pleaſing waters fall to eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:31488:69"/> when wealth but ſhifteth to another ſtand, then men looke upon us at a diſtance, and ſtiffen themſelves as if they were in Armour, leaſt (if they ſhould comply us) they ſhould get a wound in the cloſe. Adverſity is like <hi>Penelopes</hi> night, which undoes all that the day did weave; 'tis a miſery, that the knowledge of ſuch a bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as a friend is, can hardly be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſad misfortune; for we can never thorowly try him but in the kick of malignant chance; and till we have tryed him, our knowledge can be called but by the name of hope. What a pitifull plight is poore diſtempered man in, when he can neither be happy without a friend, nor yet know him to be a true friend without his being unhappy? Our fortunes, and our ſelves, are things ſo cloſely linked, that we know not which is the cauſe of the love that we finde, when theſe two ſhall part, we may then diſcover to which of them affection will make winge; when they are covied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we know not which is in purſuit; when they riſe and breake, we ſhall then ſee which is aimed at. I confeſſe,

But the tryall of faith is, by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what we will doe for God; to truſt him for eſtate, when we have the evidence in our Iron Cheſt, is eaſie, and not thankes worthy; but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him for what we cannot ſee, as 'tis more hard for man to doe, ſo 'tis more acceptable to God if it be done; for in that act we make confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Deity.

And of this tryall excellent is the uſe we may make, if we finde our faith upon the teſt firme, it will be unto us a perpetuall banquet. If we finde it daſtardly ſtarting aſide, knowing the weakneſſe, we may ſtrive to ſenew it with a ſtronger nerve, ſo that it ever is either the aſſurance of our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or the way whereby we may finde it; without this confidence in a power that is able alwaies to aide us, we wander both in trouble and doubt.

               <p>TIs the eaſieſt part to cenſure, or to contradict a truth, for truth is but one, and ſeeming truths are many, and few workes are performed without errours: No man can write ſix lines but there may be ſomething one may carpe at, if he be diſpoſed to cavill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Opinions are as various as falſe, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is from every tongue a ſeverall.

Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance gives diſparagement a louder tongue than knowledge does; wiſe men had rather know then tell, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſpraiſes are at the beſt but the faults of uncharitable wit; any Clown may ſee the furrow is but crooked, but where is the man that can plough me a ſtraight one? The beſt workes are but a kinde of Meſſalany, the cleaneſt Corne will not be without ſome ſoyle, no, not after often winnowing: there is a tincture of corruption that dyes even all mortality. I would wiſh men in workes of others to examine two things before they judge, whether it be more good than ill, and whether they themſelves could at firſt have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it better: If it be moſt good, we doe amiſſe for ſome errours to condemne the whole; who will caſt away the whole body of the Beaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

As man is not judged good or bad for one action, or the feweſt number, but as he is moſt in generall: So, in workes we ſhould weigh the generality, and according to that, cenſure. If it be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good than ill, I thinke he deſerves ſome praiſe, for raiſing Nature above her ordinary flight: Nothing in this world can be framed ſo intirely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but that it ſhall have in it ſome delinquencies, to argue more were in the compriſer; if it were not ſo it were not from Nature, but the immediate Deity. The next, if we had never ſeene that frame, whether or no we thinke we could have mended it.

               <p>True faith is the ground of things hoped for, and the evidence of things that are not ſeene.</p>
               <p>Prayer is an humble requeſt made unto God in Chriſt, with the lively and feeling affection of the heart, faithfully beleeving to receive what we religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deſire.</p>

               <p>Many there be that can talke well, and diſcourſe well, but for inward graces they never looke, nor regard: and it is this that upholds many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: they ſee Religion is reſpected of thoſe of whom they deſire to be had in ſome eſteeme, but God ſees their Hypocriſie, and they ſhall have their reward.</p>

Shall not we much more indure a little labour here, for endleſſe happineſſe aſſured to us hereafter? this is much forgot.</p>
               <p>But here is the pitty, men labour, ſweat, taking paines, and travell here, ſpare no coſt, and all this to goe to Hell: <hi>to heape up wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi> The Devill has more ſervants in his barren and fruitleſſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, then God gets with all promiſes, and good things that he ſo liberally beſtowes upon them.</p>
               <p>Obſerve the good motions of Gods Spirit in thee, further them to the moſt advantage in thee, turne them to preſent practiſe, loſe, nor delay them not, for elſe the Devill will ſteale them away from thee.</p>
               <p>If we doe any good, the deed is Gods; if we will it, the will is Gods, and then we pleaſe God, when we will that which God wills, and not when we doe that which God wils not.</p>
               <p>Wee ought to bee as thankfull to

               <p>Light is a heavenly quallity. So is the Word of God, holy, pure, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming godly men to its own like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; to be heavenly his bread is from heaven, his affections, deſires, thoughts, indeavours, are heavenly, his way is upward, he is heavenly minded, while he is on earth, he is in heaven.</p>
               <p>Light makes a thing ful of Evidence, all the world cannot perſwade a man contrary to that he ſees; ſo doth the Word of God diſcover to us, our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in grace, and ſo ſeverely as all the world cannot ſhake the foundation of our Faith.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if we deſire to be lights, let us communicate, with the chiefeſt light: As the Sarres are ever in the preſence of the Sunne, and from his light they receive theirs. Be ſure thou placeſt thy ſelfe in Gods eye continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; ſecondly, uſe the meanes, uſe the glaſſe of Gods Word, thou ſhalt not onely ſee thy eſtate therein, but by

               <p>True patience is a fruit and effect of repentance, and humiliation for ſin.</p>
               <p>True patience is likewiſe the fruit of Faith.</p>
               <p>True patience is a fruit of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto God, and of a heart ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and made able to yeeld unto God in all things; Yea, it is indeed, a chiefe part of our obedience unto him.</p>

               <p>God finiſhed the world in ſix dayes, and Chriſt finiſhed his prayer he taught us, in ſix Petitions; that ſo the works which God formed for man, and the words which Chriſt framed for man may have a correſpondency.</p>
               <p>When we ſay, <hi>Hallowed be thy name,</hi> we meane not to make it holy; for it is holineſſe it ſelf: nor to make it more holy, for it is infinite it ſelfe: nor to keep it holy, for it is eternity it ſelfe; but to joyne with the Heavens, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his glory, and with the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſhewing his handy-worke; as then onely hallowing his Name, when we name him only holy; and therein conſiſting our work of Sanctifying him, when in him we acknowledge our workes to be ſanctified.</p>
               <p>And indeed, if we marke this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion well, we ſhall finde a peculiar Majeſty, an extraordinary prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in it above all the other: for it is

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, O my Soule, doe thou by this Name of God, as <hi>David</hi> (in the 1 19 <hi>Pſalm</hi>) doth by the Law of God, whereof he ſeemes jealous, and ſo loath to leave it, that the word is no ſooner out of his mouth but he ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in againe; and there is not ſo ſhort a ſentence in all this long <hi>Pſalm,</hi> but the Law of God is a word in it.

               <p>In ſome the world governes, and he who is Prince of this world, the Devill, and this government is a very tyranny, the people here are not ſubjects, but ſlaves, they have fetters on all their faculties; and if they doe not feele them, it is becauſe they are paſt fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The ayre of this place is only Foggs, and Miſts, which both blinde theis eyes, and infect their ſpirits, and makes it their Paradice to be wallowing in puddle. He is no true Prince, but
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:31488:77"/> an uſurper, and therefore rules all by force, and falſhood. He takes upon him to be their Pilate, launcheth them out into the maine, and then leaves them to ſtormes and tempeſts; and their Haven is to ſplit againſt the rocks.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:31488:78"/> for his Scepter: He hath Wiſdom for his Councellor, Almightineſſe for his Guard, and Eternity for his date: He hath Heaven for his Pallace, the Earth for his Foot-ſtoole, and Hell for his Priſon: He hath Laws to which Nature aſſents, and Reaſon ſubſcribes, that doe not fetter us, but free us: for by them Nature gets the wings of Grace, and tranſcends the Earth: Reaſon gets the eyes of Faith, and aſcends up to Heaven: He hath a yoke indeed, but it is eaſie: a burthen, but it is light: his reward is with him, and his work before him. He is eſtabliſhed in his Soveraignty, not by his Subjects election of him, but by his election of his Subjects: not as raiſing himſelfe to a higher title, but an humbling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to a lower Calling: and as not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it from a Predeceſſor who is before all, ſo never leaving it to a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor who is after all.</p>
               <p>This is the place where my Soul ſhall dwell, here will I pitch my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle: Only, O Lord, let me be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the number of thy Subjects, and indue me with the priviledges of thy Kingdome, and I will freely and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:31488:78"/> faithfully ſerve thee for ever. Other Lords beſides thee have heretofore ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us, but now we will remember thee only, and only thy name.</p>
               <p>When we make this Petition to God that his Kingdom may come, we ſhould do well to remember a Petition which God makes to us; <hi>My Sonne, give me thine heart:</hi> for unleſſe we give God our hearts, whither do we think this Kingdom ſhould come? For if it come to the ears, as often times it makes offer at the hearing of Gods Word, it findes that a thorow-faire which lyes open on every ſide, and no fit place to make a reſidence in, and therefore commonly goes away as it came, and makes no ſtay there. And if it come to the eyes, as ſometimes it doth at the ſight of Gods workes, it findes them not able to ſtay long open, but muſt have their windows ſhut in, and ſo are apt to keep it out: or if they ſtand open, they are apt to let in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which this Kingdom likes not, and therefore cannot abide to abide there neither, but vaniſh away. And indeed, theſe are the out places, this Kingdom loves to be within us, as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:31488:79"/> Chriſt ſaith: <hi>The kingdome of God is within you.</hi> And we have no place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us fit to make a ſeat of a Kingdom but only our heart, and this indeed hath no back doore to let it out, as the eare hath: nor no Percullis to keep it out, as the eye hath: but it hath a large entrance, and a boundleſs circuit, and therefore moſt fit to give this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom entertainment. And yet as fit as it is, God will not have it unleſs we give it him: and he will not have it ſo neither, unleſs we give it him all: for it is againſt his nature to have a Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and he cannot abide to heare of Moyties, either he muſt have all, or he hath nothing at all: To be a peice for God, and a peice for the world, is to be all for the world. To conclude, God at all, is to exclude him from all: Wherefore O my Soul, mangle not thy heart in giving it to God, but give it him all, and think thy ſelfe happy that he will take it all: For the more he poſſeſſeth it, the freer he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it: the more he dwelleth in it, the fairer he builds it: the more he reigneth in it, the more richer he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dornes it. O my Lord God, that thou
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:31488:79"/> wouldeſt come and dwell in my heart as the owner of it, and reigne in my heart as the King of it: I ſhould not then envie the Pallaces of Princes, nor the Kingdoms of the Earih: ſeeing I ſhould have within my ſelfe a Pallace and a Kingdome, not only to equall but far to exceed them.</p>
               <p>O what happineſſe will this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom bring, and wherein doth happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe conſiſt? If in dainty fare? we ſhall all eat and drink with Chriſt at his Fathers Table. If in fine cloathes? we ſhall all be cloathed, in long white Robes. If in curious muſick? we ſhall heare the quire of Angels continually ſinging. If in knowledge? we ſhall know, as we are know. If in dominion? we ſhall judge the Angels. If in joy? our joy ſhall be full, and none ſhall be able to take it from us. If in glorious ſights? we ſhall ſee the bleſſed face of God, which is the glory of all ſights, and the ſight of all glory.</p>
               <p>O happy Kingdom, ô happy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, ô happy we to whom it ſhall come; that we can never be attentive enough in praying, never earneſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in longing that this Kingdome may come.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:31488:80"/>
               <p>The next is, <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.</hi> It is a fearefull thing to make this Petition to God; if we doe not withall make it a rule to our ſelves, that all the actions of our life may be ſquared by it.</p>
               <p>And therefore, O my ſoule, if mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of profit be offered to thee, lay it to this Rule; whether it be to the will of God, or no: for if it be not, what great advantage ſoever it make ſhew of, account it but loſſe. If matter of honour be offered unto thee, lay it to this Rule, whether it be according to the will of God, or no: for if it be not, what great advancement ſoever it pretend, account it but ſhame. If mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of pleaſure be offered unto thee, lay it to this Rule, whether it be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of God, or no: for if it be not, what pleaſing ſuggeſtion ſoever it hath, account it but miſery. It was conceived by <hi>Ahab,</hi> that it would be for his profit, to buy <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard; but when he would not lay it to this Rule, he paid for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, with his bloud to doggs. It was pretended to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that it would be for his honour, to purſue the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:31488:80"/> but when he would not lay it to this Rule, he periſhed himſelfe, and all his Hoſt in the red Sea. It was ſuggeſted to <hi>Salomon,</hi> that it would be for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to entertaine the love of ſtrange women: but when he would not lay it to this Rule; God laid it to his charge, both raiſing up adverſaries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelfe, and renting the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from his Sonne to his ſervant. We muſt therefore endeavour to make it a Rule to our ſelves firſt, and then we may ſafely make it a Petition to God: otherwiſe, if we ſay, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> and intend not to doe it: we ſhall but turne the Petition from active to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive: Gods will into his anger, and draw it downe to be done upon us in earth, as it was done upon the Angels in heaven.</p>
               <p>Many, can ſay this Petition devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, ſo long as they underſtand it not; but when they are tould how Chriſt ſaid it, <hi>Not my will, but thy will;</hi> and thereby come to know, that for praying to doe Gods will, is to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt doing their owne wills, againſt their unlawfull luſts, againſt their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous deſires, againſt their ambitious
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:31488:81"/> deſignes, againſt their malicious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, and ſuch like. Then it ſtricks cold to their hearts. Their tongues cleave to the roofe of their mouthes: and they could wiſh the Petition might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be made.</p>
               <p>But he that underſtands it, and yet ſtands to it; he that ſpeaks it, more from his heart, then with his tongue; he that is reſolved to ſay it, becauſe he ſaith as he is reſolved, this man makes it a prayer for himſelfe, and an <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> to God, and ſhall reape the fruit of both in the due time: to the other it proves but as the Sacrifice of fooles: and if it make a noiſe, it is but as the tinkling of a Cymball. Muſick at which God ſtops his eares, onely the Devill makes himſelf meery.</p>
               <p>O Lord God, let it be the pleaſure of thy will, that I may take pleaſure in doing thy will: for unleſſe it be thy pleaſure, it can never be my will: for though we may be good followers, yet we are no good beginners, &amp; therfore, though it pleaſe thee to ſay, turne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and I will turne unto you: as though we ſhould begin firſt, yet we
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:31488:81"/> are faine to returne it back, and ſay: <hi>Turne us O Lord, and, we ſhall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> For we, God knowes, are too un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weldy to turne us of our ſelves, it muſt be done by ſtrong hand, and none hath ſtrength enough to doe it: but thou O God, who art the God of ſtrength.</p>
               <p>And if we would ſtrive as much with the Angels for holineſſe, as we doe with men for place, and dignity, we ſhould finde God as ready to take our parts, as he was to take our Nature, and by ſuch a help, of ſuch a helper, we ſhould be able to make good our ſaying: <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O Lord God, If I cannot be like thee in holineſſe: yet let me be like the Angels in obedience, and if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine to neither, let me at leaſt, aſpire to both, and what I want in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and performance, make me to ſupply with Vowes and Payers.</p>
               <p>And here now ſeemes a fit place to ſit down and wonder, at the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able love, and bounty of God, expreſſed towards us, in theſe three Petitions; for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:31488:82"/> by the firſt, we are aſſured of eternity: by the ſecond of a Kingdom: by the third, to be like the Angels: or if we like it better to ſay; by the firſt, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what we ſhall be as Angels: by the ſecond, what we ſhall have, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; by the third, what we ſhall do; the will of God.</p>
               <p>Theſe are bleſſings worthy to come from a heavenly Father; theſe are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which worthily become a bountifull Maſter.</p>
               <p>And now, let the ſwine (fleſh and blood) go murmure againſt God, that he is a hard Father, and a bad Maſter: and that there is no profit in ſerving him, becauſe he gives them not the mire of the world to wallow in: as though he had no other way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his favours, but by clods of earth.</p>
               <p>But do thou, ô my ſoule, meditate upon theſe Petitions, and in them, upon theſe bleſſings, and in theſe, upon the infinit love, and bounty of God: and think how happy thou art to have ſuch a Father: how much thou art bound to love ſuch a Maſter: and think not much to love him with thy whole
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:31488:82"/> heart: ſeeing he hath bleſſings to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon thee, which cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy heart.</p>
               <p>Think not much to ſubmit thy ſelf wholly to his will, ſeeing, his will is, to give thee beauty for aſhes: the oyle of gladneſſe for mourning, that we ſhall ever find it, a moſt happy thing for us to ſay, <hi>Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</hi> But why do we ſay, <hi>thy will be done in earth,</hi> which is done in earth already: and that by creatures, which one would think we are never able to do it: He hath ſet bounds to the Sea, which it muſt not paſſe, and the Sea as raging as it is, and provoked by all the Rivers of the earth, that come running into it, as it were for the nonce, to make it paſſe its bounds, yet keepes it ſelf preciſely within the limits: He hath appointed the earth to ſtand ſtill, and not for to move, and the earth, though but hanging in the Ayre, and nothing at all to hang upon: yet offers not ſo much, as once to ſtir: He hath charged the Trees to bring forth fruit, and the Trees, though almoſt even kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with could of winter, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the tempeſts of the ſpring,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:31488:83"/> yet takes heart to come forth, and ſeeme to rejoyce, they can do as they are bidden.</p>
               <p>The very beaſts, though never ſo wild and ſavage, yet obſerve the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of their kind, and none of them incroach upon the qualities of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>And why all this? but only to do the will of God, and that which may ſeeme more ſtrange: The flowers come out of the durty earth, and yet how neate and cleane, out of the unſavory earth, and yet how freſh and fragrant? out of the ſower earth, and yet how mellifluous and ſweete? out of the duskiſh earth, and yet how orient, and virmillion? out of the unſhapen earth, and yet in what dainty ſhapes? in what curious formes? in what inamilings? and diapers of beauty? as if the earth would ſhow, that for all her being cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhe had ſomthing yet of <hi>Paradice</hi> left. And why all this? but only to do the will of God. And why then ſhould there be complaining, as though the will of God, were not done in earth.</p>
               <p>O wretched man, it is only thy ſelf, that is out of tune, in this harmony.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:31488:83"/> Man that ſhould be beſt, is of all the worſt; that ſhould be cleaneſt, is of all the fowleſt; that ſhould be moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, is of all the moſt deformed; moſt full of graces, yet moſt void of grace; of moſt underſtanding to direct his will, yet of leaſt will to follow the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of underſtanding. Man indued with celeſtiall qualities, yet leaves them all, to incroach upon the qualities of every beaſt: upon the obcaenity of ſwine in drunkenneſſe, upon the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of Cormorants, in covetouſneſs, upon the craftineſſe of Foxes in fraud: upon the cruelty of Tygers, in malice, as if he would ſtrive to exceede his firſt parents in tranſgreſſing, and try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God had any greater puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment left, then caſting out of <hi>Paradice.</hi> That if Chriſt would have ſerved us in our kind, and as we deſerve, he needed not to have gone for paterns to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he might have found paterns, good enough for us amongſt the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Creatures of the earth.</p>
               <p>And as he tould the Phariſees, that the Queen of the <hi>South,</hi> ſhould riſe up in judgement againſt them, ſo he might have told us, the flowers, the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:31488:84"/> trees, the beaſts, ſhall all riſe up in judgement againſt man. That we have more need to ſay. O that my head were waters, and mine eyes a Fountain of teares, that I might weep day and night.</p>
               <p>Then after trees and beaſts have done Gods will, to come after them all, but with only ſaying. <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O God ſo frame our wills, that they may be fit links, to be faſtned to this Chaine of thy will, that as one link drawn on, drawes on another: ſo our ſpirits being guided by thy grace, may be guides to our fleſh, and that our fleſh, as living by thee, may live to thee, knowing, that though the way of thy will may be troubleſome, in the going, yet the journey ſhall be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the ending; and though it be the ſecret of thy will, that in doing it, we ſhall meete with many croſſes, yet it is the purpoſe of thy will, that by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, we ſhall purchaſe many joyes, and therefore can have no cauſe to make us a fraid to ſay. <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:31488:84"/>
               <p>And now having thought theſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to be for ſuch moſt proper, let us conforme our ſelves according to them. When we ſay, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> let us lift up the voyces of our hearts, as if we were now joyning with the Angels, in ſinging their Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah. When we ſay, <hi>Thy Kingdome come,</hi> let us raiſe our thoughts, as now offering to ſet our hands to the Petition of the Saints in heaven: When we ſay, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> let us fix our minds wholly as in the ſolemnity of dedicating of our ſelves to God, with all the faithfull upon earth. When we ſay, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread,</hi> let us humble our ſelves, as being in ſtate of other Creatures, and are glad to joyne with them in their common ſuit. When we ſay, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> let us think our ſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled in the company of Penitents, and as the greateſt ſinners choſen ſpeakeſmen to preſent their ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And when we ſay, <hi>Leade us not into temptation,</hi> let us acknowledge our ſelves in the number and weakneſſe of little Children, and are glad to joyne with them in crying for help; that the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:31488:85"/> Angell of Infants, which alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the face of God, may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by him to work our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>But what ſhould be the cauſe that in the three latter Petitions we ſeem to be altogether for our ſelves, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by our ſaying, <hi>Give us, Forgive us, Deliver us;</hi> but in the three for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer there is no mention of us at all, as though we were no parties to them at all? Is it not that we are, or ought to be more jealous of Gods honour, than carefull of our owne benefits? And therefore when we ſay, <hi>Hallowed be thy name,</hi> we dare not ſay, of us, leaſt we ſhould make God a Muſick of too few voyces. And when we ſay, <hi>Thy Kingdome come,</hi> we dare not ſay, to us, leaſt we ſhould aſſigne his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom too ſmall a Territory. And when we ſay, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> we dare not ſay, by us, leaſt we ſhould ſtint God in the number of his ſervants. But we ſay, <hi>Hallowed be thy name,</hi> and ſtop there, that ſo no mouth may be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from hallowing it. We ſay, <hi>Thy Kingdome come,</hi> but name not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſo it may be intended to

               <p>Many would deſire to know, and prize it at a great rate, how the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> might get the knowledge to be aſſured when their ſins are forgiven, and yet it is a knowledge eaſily to be had, and every man may tell himſelfe; for if thou findeſt in thy heart a loathing of thy former ſins, and a reſolution to continue in amendment of life, and ſpecially a fixed charity to forgive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; thou mayeſt be aſſured thou art in the favour of God, and all thy ſins paſt are forgiven thee; but if thou continueſt to take delight in thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins, and art unreſolved in refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thy courſes; and eſpecially, if thou findeſt in thy ſelf a deſire of revenge, and art implacable towards others, thou mayeſt then be aſſured thou art ſtill in the ſtate of Gods diſpleaſure, thy ſins are not yet forgiven; for, theſe things are not only the ſignes, but the certaine effects of Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of us, when we confeſſe, and be grieved for our owne treſpaſſes to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:31488:86"/> him, and are compaſſionate and relen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the treſpaſſes of others to us.</p>
               <p>There is no deed ſo acceptable to God, as to take all thankfully which he laies upon us; for not to murmure, or not to caſt our eyes upon vanity, are in themſelves any great matters; but when a man murmures not in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, which gives ſo many cauſes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience; or when a man caſts not his eyes upon vanity in proſperity, which miniſters ſo many occaſions of alure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, this is a man after Gods owne heart; and this is one to whom the Devill may ſay, as he ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> but the difficulty of doing this, and the danger of not doing this, gives us all juſt cauſe to ſay, <hi>Leade us not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O my Soul, if thou canſt not be ſtrong enough to reſiſt ſinne, be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to confeſſe it with contrition; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve into teares for that which is paſt, reſolve upon amendment in that which is to come; and if thou canſt do this, thou ſhalt finde it the true balme of <hi>Gilead,</hi> and though thy ſins were as red as ſcarlet, they ſhall be made as white as ſnow.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:31488:86"/>
               <p>And more, to ſpeak of hallowing Gods name: it may not be unfit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the three firſt Petitions, as they are only hallowings, or Hallelujas: for obſerving the difference of the ſongs, we ſhall perceive the difference of the ſingers.</p>
               <p>The firſt when we ſay, <hi>Hallowed be thy name,</hi> is the Hallelujah of Angels, and we may truly ſay, is the ſong of ſongs: not only, becauſe it is ſung with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſſing: but becauſe it ſhall be ſung without ending, and is both the cauſe and the effect, both the ſigne and the ſubſtance of our eternal happineſs.</p>
               <p>The ſecond (when we ſay) <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> is the Hallelujah, of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The third, (when we ſay, <hi>Thy will be done</hi>) is the Hallelujah of the Saints on earth: and is an aſſpiring to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; but an aſſpiring in a remote de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: for while they are in the world,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:31488:87"/> they are ſubject to all the rubs of the world: while they live in the fleſh, to all infirmities of the fleſh: yet they have a confidence, though no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or an aſſurance, though but in confidence: and therefore are remiſſe, but not dejected, bould, but not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, not out of heart, not out of feare.</p>
               <p>And may it not here be obſerved, that as we begin in ſaying, <hi>Hallowed be thy name,</hi> ſo we end in acting the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it: and our firſt and laſt words, are all for his glory, who is the firſt and the laſt: And theſe three Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, ſeeme to anſwer to our three firſt Petitions: <hi>Hallowed be thy name, for thine is the glory: Thy Kingdom come, for thine is the Kingdom: Thy will be done, for thine is the power.</hi>

               <p>And we ſeeme to ſing, not only in the firſt, an uniſone with the Angels: but in all the three, the ſame ditty with the Saints in Heaven, for their Hallelujah is, Thou art worthy, ô Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power: and ours here, <hi>Thine is the Kingdom, the power and the glory:</hi> That having ſung the ſong of Saints and Angels here on the

               <p>The children of God, begotten a

               <p>It were a great blemiſh to a godly man, to be wrongfully ſuſpected to be the father of a wicked Son; much more is God diſhonoured, by ſuch as would ſeeme to be, but are not of his ſeed. For they that are of God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, cannot but in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him, in being righteous, as he is righteous: that is, by caſting off the old man, which is corrupt, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row deceivable luſts, and to put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſſe and true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
               <p>This caſting off, and putting on, doth teach us, that there is in us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that befits us not to retaine, if we will be the true Sonnes of God: not by reputation amongſt men, but by imputation in Chriſt. What is to he caſt off, and what is to be put on, is plainely expreſſed in the Apoſtles
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:31488:88"/> words, namely, to caſt off all decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable luſts, which includeth all things forbidden, and to put on righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which implyeth a ſpirituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment of all heavenly graces; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which, none is of that ſingular force, vertue, and effect, as is, zealous, and hearty prayer, in faith unfained; which none can effectually make, but ſuch as have put on this new man. For the old man knoweth not how to pray, being clothed with corruption: and blinded with the miſt of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>The new man onely ſhaped in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, knoweth to whom, when, in whom, for what, and how to pray: all which circumſtances, are duely to be conſidered in Prayer: and yet none of theſe, doth the naturall man; that is, the olde man truely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend: and conſequently, the lip-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that he pretendeth, to beſtow in prayer, is not onely, not profitable, but ſinfull.</p>
               <p>To pray unto God with the lips, for any corporall benefit, and yet to have t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:31488:89"/> upon naturall meanes, is a kind of ſpirituall Adultery.</p>
               <p>For, what man is he, that having a wife, outwardly affable, uſing words of love unto him, and yet her heart ſet upon another man, will not think her a faithleſſe and unchaſte wife? And is God leſſe jealous thinke wee? who craveth our hearts, when we ſhall worſhip him in words, and outward ſhew of works? when our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cannot but tell us, that we aske that of God, which we inwardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve more probably, and poſſible to be obtained, by meanes without him.</p>
               <p>Is not this a faſilfying of our faith, and diſſembling of our prayers? Is not this a manifeſt breach of the Law, that ſayes, <hi>we ſhall have no other Gods, but JEHOVAH.</hi> As alſo, <hi>not to take his Name in vaine,</hi> as they doe, <hi>which call upon him with their lips, their hearts farre from him.</hi>

               <p>God requireth not our prayers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath neede of them; as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice beneficiall, or profitable unto him; but becauſe we have need of his graces, and bleſſings, and that he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:31488:89"/> loveth us, in his beloved Sonne, he willeth us to pray unto him for every ſpirituall and corporall bleſſing: And although it be true, that he knowes whereof we have need: yet in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon, he that wanteth, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines to ask, he is not worthy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that whereof he hath need.</p>
               <p>And heavily it will befall them, who having received ſo many bleſſings at Gods hands, are no whit the more moved to love him: And ſo many threats for their unbeliefe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and yet not moved to feare him.</p>
               <p>Will they not be drawne, then from their deceiveable vanities? Will they rather then for leſſe then an Aple, or a meſſe of Pottage, diſclaime their Birth-rights and loſe that Kingdom, and Crowne, ſo dearely purchaſed for the faithfull.</p>
               <p>Nay, were loſſe of it all, it were not ſo horrible: If a man miſſing the good promiſed, could avoid the danger threatned, it would ſomething mittigate the diſpairing Conſcience, and eaſe the troubled minde. If af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Nor feareth other Hell, then the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, penury, and afflictions of the ſame.</p>
               <p>But the caſe is otherwiſe: They that miſſe the Kingdome of heaven, by not beleeving the promiſes of God, by not praying unto God, for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the courſe of their lives, may aſſure themſelves, though they ſeeme not yet to beleeve it: that there remaines for them, and attends them, the god of darkneſſe, and the Angel of Horrour, and of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But poſſeſſe thou me, my ſweet Soveraigne, and raigne in my body, by obedience to thy Lawes: and in my ſoule, by confidence in thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>

               <p>PRide is the greateſt enemy to reaſon, and diſcretion the greateſt oppoſite to pride; for whiles wiſdom makes Art the Axe of nature, pride makes nature the Axe of Art: The wiſe man ſhapes his apparell to his body; the proud man ſhapes his body by his apparell: Tis no marvel then, if he know not himſelf, when he is not to day like him he was yeſterday.</p>
               <p>And leſſe marvell, if good men will not know him, when he forgets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and all goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhould feare whilſt I thus change my ſhape, leaſt my maker ſhould change his opinion, and finding me
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:31488:97"/> not like him he made me, reject me as none of his making.</p>
               <p>I would any day put off the cauſe of my apparell, but not every day put on new faſhioned apparell; I ſee great reaſon to be aſhamed of my pride, but no reaſon to be proud of my ſhame.</p>
               <p>Hipocricy deſires to ſeeme good, rather then be ſo: honeſty deſires to be good, rather then ſeeing ſo: The worldlings purchaſed reputation by the ſale of deſert: wiſe men, by deſert with the hazard of reputation.</p>
               <p>I would do much to heare well, more to deſerve well, and rather loſe opinion then merit.</p>
               <p>It ſhall more joy me that I know my ſelf what I am, then it ſhall grieve me to heare what others report me. I had rather deſerve well without praiſe, then do ill with comendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more certain then death, nothing more uncertain then the time of dying.</p>
               <p>I will therefore be prepared for that at all times, which may come at any time, muſt come at one time or
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:31488:97"/> another: I ſhall not haſten my death by being ſtill ready, but ſweeten it: It makes me not dye the ſooner, but bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Had I not more confidence in the truth of my Saviour, then in the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men: poverty might ſtagger my faith, and bring my thoughts into a perplexed purgatory, wherein are the poor bleſſed, if pardon ſhall be only by expence? Or how is it hard for a rich man to enter into Heaven, if mony may buy out the paſt, preſent, and future ſins of himſelf, his deceaſſed and ſucceeding progenie? It Heaven be thus ſould, what been fit has my poverty, by the priſe alreapy paid? I find no happineſſe in roome on earth. Tis happineſſe for me to have roome in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Nature bids me love my ſelf, and hate all that hurt me; Reaſon bids me love my friends, and hate thoſe that envy me; Religion bids love all, and hate none; Nature ſheweth care, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wit, Religion love, Nature may induce me, Reaſon perſwade me, but Religion ſhall rule me.</p>
               <p>I will hearken to Nature in much, to Reaſon in more, to Religion in all.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:31488:98"/>
               <p>Nature ſhall make me carefull of my ſelf, but hurtfull to none; Reaſon ſhall make me wiſe for my ſelf, but harmleſſe to all; Religion ſhall make me loving to all, but not careleſſe of my ſelf: I may heare the former, I will harken only to the latter; I ſubſcribe to ſomthings in all, to all things in Religion.</p>
